We reviewed and discussed all the pull requests that team Hydroponic has given to us. We as a team have reviewed each file that team Hydroponic has made improvements on.

As for right now, we plan on doing more internal testing with the suggested pull requests in order to determine if the features are something that we would like to continue to implement. There are some features that look extremely useful in the long run for the user to determine the GET request.

The comma parsing would be extremely useful. However as of right now we will continue to test and implement on it on our own. As of 11/12/23, we have locally tried suggest code, and we planning on adding some features throughout the week.
