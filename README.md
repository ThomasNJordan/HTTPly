HTTPly
Thomas Jordan, Mason Moore

HTTPly is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the way users interact with HTTP POST and GET requests by providing them with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. This innovative platform addresses a significant challenge encountered by both novice and seasoned API and web designersâ€”mastering the intricacies of GET and POST requests. A comprehensive understanding of these requests is paramount, as they form the backbone of various web functionalities, including authentication, managing complex fetch queries, orchestrating the loading of data and JavaScript in precise sequences, ensuring input data is thoroughly sanitized (even the kind that remains invisible to ordinary users), and so much more.

Our Dynamic Scripting Language allows users to effortlessly assemble custom HTTP requests using an intuitive visual approach. By employing Blockly-inspired components that can be seamlessly dragged and dropped, users can construct intricate HTTP request chains, manipulate incoming HTTP data, and script elaborate sequences of requests far more accessible.

The primary objective of this project is to simplify the difficult task of handling multifaceted HTTP request chains, thereby achieving several valuable outcomes:

1. **Facilitating Collaborative Design:** HTTPly promotes collaboration among designers by providing a common platform where complex HTTP request workflows can be designed and shared. Teams can work harmoniously on intricate projects without the need for extensive coding expertise.

2. **Educating Non-Technical Team Members:** HTTPly acts as an educational tool, enlightening non-technical team members about the inner workings of the code. Through its intuitive interface, those with varying technical backgrounds can gain insights into the functionings of APIs and HTTP requests.

3. **Streamlining Onboarding:** For new engineers entering the field, HTTPly serves as a valuable resource. It accelerates the onboarding process by offering a hands-on, practical way to learn the intricacies of API interactions and HTTP requests. Which can allow for a quicker way to learn this important task.

HTTPly aims to bridge the gap between the complexity of HTTP requests and the accessibility required for efficient web development.



HTTPly's project scope extends beyond the realm of HTTP request manipulation and into the domains of parsing, interpretation, and compilation. Parsing plays a pivotal role as the platform dissects user-generated HTTP request chains, breaking them down into meaningful components and syntax. This parsing process is crucial for identifying and validating the structure of requests, ensuring their compliance with HTTP standards, and extracting key parameters and data. Interpretation comes into play when HTTPly translates these parsed components into executable code. The platform interprets user intentions and configurations, generating the underlying scripts that drive the HTTP request chains.
